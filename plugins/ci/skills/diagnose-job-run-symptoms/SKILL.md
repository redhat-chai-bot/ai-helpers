# Diagnose Job Run Symptoms

Sippy Symptoms are known-failure signatures for OpenShift CI. A symptom is a rule made of a file pattern (a glob over a CI job run's artifact files, e.g. `**/build-log.txt`) and a matcher (`string` = substring, `regex` = regular expression, `none` = file merely exists, `cel` = a compound CEL expression over other label names). When a symptom matches a job run's artifacts, Sippy applies one or more **Labels** — human-readable tags like `InfraFailure` — to that run. Labels appear in the Sippy UI and Spyglass and help everyone quickly recognize known failure modes without re-debugging them. You do not need any prior Sippy knowledge to use this skill.

This skill takes a Prow job run URL and explains which symptoms matched the run and what each applied label means — including the matched file and text.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- A CI job failed and you want to know if it is a **known failure mode** before debugging it from scratch
- You are about to create a new symptom and want to check what already matched the run (see `manage-symptoms`)
- You want a plain-language explanation of the labels shown on a run in the Sippy UI or Spyglass

## Prerequisites

1. **Default mode** (already-applied labels): only network access to public GCS (`https://storage.googleapis.com`) and the public Sippy API (`https://sippy.dptools.openshift.org`) — **no authentication required**.

2. **Deep mode** (`--deep`, server-side dry-run rescan): a Bearer token from the DPCR cluster.
   - Must be logged into the DPCR cluster via `oc login`
   - Cluster API: `https://api.cr.j7t7.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443`
   - Use the `oc-auth` skill to obtain the token (see the token-acquisition snippet in `reevaluate-job-runs/SKILL.md`); prefer `export SIPPY_TOKEN=...` over `--token` — argv is visible in process listings

3. **Python 3**: Python 3.6 or later, standard library only.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Default mode — explain already-applied labels

```bash
python3 plugins/ci/skills/diagnose-job-run-symptoms/diagnose_job_run.py \
  "https://prow.ci.openshift.org/view/gs/test-platform-results/logs/<job>/<build_id>"
```

For each applied label the summary output shows: the label title and explanation, links to associated Jira issues, the symptom that applied it (summary, matcher type, file pattern, match string), and the actual matched file and matched text from the run's artifacts.

### Step 2: Deep mode — server-side rescan

Use when the run predates the current symptom set or shows no labels. This asks Sippy to re-scan the run with `dry_run: true` — it **writes nothing** and reports what would match now:

```bash
python3 plugins/ci/skills/diagnose-job-run-symptoms/diagnose_job_run.py \
  "<prow_url>" --deep
```

Note: deep mode reports label IDs only — the matched file/text detail is only available in default mode (it comes from the GCS artifacts).

### Step 3: Nothing matched?

If default mode finds no labels, first suggest `--deep`: the run may simply never have been scanned, and default mode cannot distinguish that from "scanned, nothing matched". If a deep rescan also finds nothing and the user has identified the failure cause, guide them to the `manage-symptoms` skill to create a new symptom (and `reevaluate-job-runs` to apply it retroactively to past runs).

**Arguments**:
- `prow_url`: Prow job run URL (`https://prow.ci.openshift.org/view/gs/...`, positional, required)

**Options**:
- `--deep`: Server-side dry-run rescan via the reevaluate API (requires a token)
- `--token <token>`: Bearer token from the oc-auth skill (only needed with `--deep`; optional if the `SIPPY_TOKEN` environment variable is set, which is preferred — argv is visible in process listings; `--token` takes precedence)
- `--format json|summary`: Output format (default: summary)

## API Details

**Default mode** uses the public GCS JSON API (no auth):

- List label artifacts: `GET https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/{bucket}/o?prefix={path}/artifacts/job_labels/`
- Download each object: `GET https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/{bucket}/o/{object}?alt=media`

**GCS `job_labels` artifact schema (verified live 2026-07):** each `*.json` object under `artifacts/job_labels/` contains one wrapped entry (a `label-summary.html` file is also present and skipped):

```json
{
  "symptom_label_v1": {
    "symptom": {"id": "...", "summary": "...", "matcher_type": "string",
                "file_pattern": "...", "match_string": "...", "label_ids": ["..."]},
    "label": {"id": "...", "label_title": "...", "explanation": "...",
              "bugs": ["OCPBUGS-12345"]},
    "file_match": "artifacts/.../nodes.json",
    "text_match": "the exact text that matched"
  }
}
```

The script also cross-references `GET /api/jobs/labels` and `GET /api/jobs/symptoms` on the public Sippy API to enrich entries with current explanations and Jira associations (embedded copies are snapshots from labeling time).

**Deep mode** calls `POST https://sippy-auth.dptools.openshift.org/api/jobs/runs/reevaluate` with `{"prow_job_build_ids": ["<build_id>"], "dry_run": true}` — same request/response as the `reevaluate-job-runs` skill.

## Error Handling

- **Bad / non-Prow URL**: Must contain `/view/gs/` and end in a numeric build ID (exit 1 client-side).
- **GCS 404 or no `job_labels` artifacts**: The run may be too old (artifacts pruned) or was never scanned — suggest `--deep` to rescan server-side.
- **No labels found**: Not an error — the script prints guidance (try `--deep` first, then create a new symptom via `manage-symptoms`).
- **401/403 or HTML login page in deep mode**: Token missing/expired (the SSO proxy may return a login page instead of 401) — refresh via the `oc-auth` skill.
- **HTML gateway error page or non-JSON body in deep mode**: Transient gateway error (likely 504) — retry later.
- **Sippy API unreachable**: exit 1 with a clear message.

**Exit Codes**:
- `0`: Diagnosis completed (including "no labels found")
- `1`: Validation, network, or API error
