# openshift-developer

Executable workflows for OpenShift development.

These workflows are meant to be a common engine for different consumption models: 

- Developer's laptop
- Shared infrastructure like Prow for the OCPBUG autofix platform
- Slack chai-bot

 Each skill and command is a self-contained unit of work that any of these environments can invoke identically.

## Common workflows

### Pre-PR (author loop)

Run `/openshift-developer:jira-solve` for the end-to-end workflow. It analyzes the Jira issue, uses `determine-complexity` to choose a proportional skill chain, and invokes `implement`, `code-review:pre-commit-review`, `check-gates`, and `create-pr` when appropriate.

Alternatively, invoke the building blocks directly when you need manual control:

1. `/openshift-developer:implement` — Implement the ticket or apply findings from `/code-review:pre-commit-review`.
2. `/openshift-developer:check-gates` — Loop until requirements, tests, lint, builds, production readiness, and a clean worktree are all satisfied.
3. `/openshift-developer:create-pr` — Push the completed branch and create the Jira-linked PR.

### OpenShift backport (chai-bot / RWS)

1. `/openshift-developer:backport` — coordinator playbook: plan the Jira clone
   chain with `ocp_backport_*` tools, open one cherry-pick PR per release branch,
   and monitor progression (used by Slack chai-bot).
2. `/openshift-developer:cherry-pick` — the agent applies the coordinator's
   BACKPORT BRIEF (`git cherry-pick -x`, conflict policy, tests, push). Never
   opens the PR.

### Post-PR (review loop)

1. `/openshift-developer:has-review-work` — Gate: `COMMENT_WORK` (review comments) and/or `CI_WORK` (new non-optional CI failures)?
2. `/openshift-developer:address-review-pr` — Fetch reviewer comments, categorize by priority, make code changes, post replies, and push.
3. `/openshift-developer:address-ci-failures` — Triage failing CI checks; fix only PR-caused failures, report infra/pre-existing issues.

Repeat steps 1-3 until the PR is approved and CI is green or non-actionable failures are reported.

## What's included

### Plugins

- `jira` — Jira automation
- `ci` — OpenShift CI / Prow job analysis
- `golang` — Go development tools
- `prodsec-skills` — Product security skills
- `git` — Git workflow automation and utilities

### Skills

- **determine-complexity** — Read-only assessment of T-shirt size and procedural route for a Jira issue or supplied work description.
- **jira-solve** — Central Jira workflow orchestrator that chooses implementation, review, gate, and delivery skills based on ticket complexity.
- **implement** — Implement Jira requirements or apply local pre-commit review findings.
- **address-review-precommit** — Deprecated compatibility alias for `implement`; retained temporarily for existing Chai callers.
- **check-gates** — Fix and revalidate until tests, lint, builds, issue requirements, production readiness, and git cleanliness all pass.
- **create-pr** — Push a completed feature branch and create a Jira-linked pull request.
- **generate-test-plan** — Generate a comprehensive manual testing guide from a Jira issue, GitHub PR URLs, or both.
- **address-review-pr** — Fetch and address PR review comments: categorizes by priority, makes code changes, posts replies, and pushes. Does not handle CI failures.
- **address-ci-failures** — Triage failing CI checks; fix only failures caused by the PR's changes, report infra/pre-existing/flake issues instead of out-of-scope fixes.
- **has-review-work** — Read-only gate: `COMMENT_WORK` (unanswered authorized review comments) and `CI_WORK` (new non-optional CI failures) for follow-up agents.

### Hooks

- **ensure-precommit** — On `SessionStart`, installs pre-commit and pre-push hooks via `pre-commit` if the repo has a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Fails if `pre-commit` is not installed. Every commit and push is then gated by the repo's hooks at zero ongoing token cost.

### MCP Servers

- **atlassian** — Atlassian MCP server (`https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp`)

## Prerequisites

- `pre-commit` — hook manager (`pip install pre-commit` or `brew install pre-commit`)
- `gitlint` — commit message linter (`pip install gitlint`)
- `gopls` — Go language server (`go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest`)
- `gh` — GitHub CLI, authenticated (`brew install gh`)
- `PyYAML` — YAML parser for OWNERS files (`pip install pyyaml`)

## Installation

Add the marketplaces (one-time):

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add openshift-eng/ai-helpers
claude plugin marketplace add RedHatProductSecurity/prodsec-skills
```

Install the bundle:

```sh
claude plugin install openshift-developer@ai-helpers
```

## Note for non-Claude Code editors

This bundle can also be installed via APM with `--target`:

```sh
apm install openshift-eng/ai-helpers/plugins/openshift-developer --global --target cursor
```
