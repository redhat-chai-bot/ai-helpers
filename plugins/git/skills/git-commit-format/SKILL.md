## Name
git:git-commit-format

## Synopsis
```
/git:git-commit-format
```

## Description
Applies conventional commit formatting rules when generating commit messages. This skill is loaded as context for other skills and workflows — it defines the commit message format, required footers, and validation rules.

## Implementation

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[footers]
```

### Commit Types

- **feat**: New features
- **fix**: Bug fixes
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- **test**: Adding/updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks
- **build**: Build system or dependency changes
- **ci**: CI/CD changes
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **revert**: Revert previous commit

### Breaking Changes

With `!` to draw attention:
```
feat!: send email when product shipped
```

With `BREAKING CHANGE` footer:
```
feat: allow config to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key now used for extending config files
```

### Required Footers

#### Signed-off-by

**ALWAYS include `Signed-off-by`** footer with name and email.

Get credentials in this priority order:
1. Environment variables: `$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` and `$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`
2. Git config: `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`
3. If neither configured, ask user to provide details

#### Commit-Message-Assisted-by

**ALWAYS include** when an AI assistant helps create or generate the commit message:
```
Commit-Message-Assisted-by: AI
```

### Gitlint Validation Rules

- Run `make run-gitlint` to validate commit messages (if the repo has a gitlint target)
- **Title line**: 120 characters maximum
- **Body line**: 140 characters maximum per line
- Use conventional commit format
- Include required footers (Signed-off-by)
- No trailing whitespace

## Return Value
- **Commit message**: A conventional commit message with type, scope, description, body, and all required footers

## Examples

1. **Simple commit**:
   ```
   docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG

   Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jdoe@example.com>
   Commit-Message-Assisted-by: AI
   ```

2. **With scope**:
   ```
   feat(azure): add workload identity support

   Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jdoe@example.com>
   Commit-Message-Assisted-by: AI
   ```

3. **Multi-paragraph with footers**:
   ```
   fix: prevent racing of requests

   Introduce request ID and reference to latest request. Dismiss
   incoming responses other than from latest request.

   Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate racing but are
   obsolete now.
